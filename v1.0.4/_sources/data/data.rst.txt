Data Download
=================

Although the tutorials below provide the steps necessary to produce your own
data, we make available the data from our code paper. These include:

* Grids of single star evolution.
* Grids of binary star evolution.
* Interpolation objects for each grid.
* Example Populations.

These datasets are available through Zenodo, or, if you would like to explore
them further, we offer an SQL server for creating custom queries. Furthermore,
POSYDON is designed to automatically download the data if they do not already
exist; however, if you would like to download all the data by hand beforehand,
we provide instructions for doing so below.


IN PROGRESS
