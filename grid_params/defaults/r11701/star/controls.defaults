   !# specifications for starting model

      ! NOTE: if you are loading a saved model,
      ! then the following initial values are NOT USED to modify the model.
      ! in particular, you cannot use these to change Y or Z of an existing model.
      ! if you want to do that, see `star_job.defaults` controls such as `change_Y`.
      ! however, these are reported in output as the initial values for the star.



         !### initial_mass

         ! initial mass in Msun units.

         ! not used when loading a saved model.
         ! however is reported in output as the initial mass of the star.

         ! if you are loading a ZAMS model and the requested mass is in the range of
         ! prebuilt models, the code will interpolate in mass using the closest prebuilt models.
         ! if the requested mass is beyond the range of the prebuilt models, the code will
         ! load the closest one and then call "relax mass" to create a model to match the request.
         ! the prebuilt range is 0.08 Msun to 100 Msun, so the `relax_mass`
         ! method is only used for extreme cases.  there are enough prebuilt models that the
         ! interpolation in mass seems to work fine for many applications.

         ! not used when loading a saved model.
         ! however is reported in output as the initial Z of the star.

         ! however, if you are loading a zams model,
         ! then `initial_z` must match one of the prebuilt values.
         ! look in the `'data/star_data/zams_models'` directory
         ! to see what prebuilt zams Z's are available.
         ! at time of writing, only 0.02 was included in the standard version of star.

         ! not used when loading a saved model or a zams model.
         ! however is reported in output as the initial Y of the star.

         ! and create initial model, and not when loading a zams model.

            ! NOTE: In addition to giving these 'f' parameters non-zero values, you should also
            ! check the settings for `mass_for_overshoot_full_on` and `mass_for_overshoot_full_off`.

            ! The switch from convective mixing to overshooting happens
            ! at a distance f0*Hp into the convection zone
            ! from the estimated location where `grad_ad == grad_rad`,
            ! where Hp is the pressure scale height at that location.
            ! A value <= 0 for f0 is a mistake -- you are required to set f0 as well as f.
            ! take a look at the following from an email concerning this:

               ! Overshooting works by taking the diffusion mixing coefficient at the edge
               ! of the convection zone and extending it beyond the zone. But -- and here's the issue --
               ! at the exact edge of the zone the mixing coefficient goes to 0.  So we don't want that.
               ! Instead we want the value of the mixing coeff NEAR the edge, but not AT the edge.
               ! The "f0" parameter determines the exact meaning of "near" for this.  It tells the code
               ! how far back into the zone to go in terms of scale height. The overshooting actually
               ! begins at the location determined by f0 back into the convection zone rather than at
               ! the edge where the diffusion coeff is ill-defined.  So, for example, if you want
               ! overshooting of 0.2 scale heights beyond the normal edge, you might want to back up
               ! 0.05 scale heights to get the diffusion coeff from near the edge and then go out
               ! by 0.25 scale heights from there to reach 0.2 Hp beyond the old boundary.  In the
               ! inlist this would mean setting the "f0" to 0.05 and the "f" to 0.25.

            ! There is no default value for f0; if you set f > 0 then you must get f0 > 0 as well.

            ! Also, the softening is primarily inside the convective region rather
            ! than penetrating strongly into the area beyond.  This is done by
            ! backing up from the boundary into the convection region to start the
            ! softening of the mixing coefficient so that most of the effect
            ! takes place before reaching the exterior of the region.  The softening
            ! extends a short way into the exterior with a decreasing value of mixing.
            ! For example, it might start a distance of `0.003*Hp` into the convective
            ! region (Hp = pressure scale height at the boundary), and then project
            ! a mixing coefficient outward from there decreasing exponentially
            ! with distance scale of `0.001*Hp`.  For those numbers, there are
            ! 3 e-foldings before reaching the boundary, so most of the drop
            ! has happened inside the convective region.  The strength of the mixing
            ! then continues to drop exponentially until it reaches some given limit.

            ! The effect of this will be to soften the jump in abundances immediately
            ! adjacent to the convective region.  That will in turn soften the jump
            ! in opacity and the corresponding jump in `grad_rad` so that there will

         ! There are several options for how `eps_grav` is calculated.
         ! These alternatives are equivalently from the "ideal" physics viewpoint,
         ! but they can be very different numerically depending on the situation.

         ! I.e., we get lnT and lnd from the newton solver directly,

         ! Also, in many cases, the cell mass coordinates don't change for the step,

         ! directly in estimating the Lagrangian time derivative
         ! (e.g., DlnT/dt = <increment in lnT>/dt instead of = (new lnT - old lnT)/dt).
         ! By avoiding the roundoff error in this way, we also get a boost numerically.
         ! With lnS we cannot do that -- we're stuck with DlnS/Dt = (new lnS - old lnS)/dt.
         ! In a perfect world with infinite precision, none of this would matter.
         ! But in practice, it turns out to make a significant difference, so

         ! schemes for getting `eps_grav`.   One situation where you need to use the lnS

   !# solver controls



         ! the following is from a response on mesa-users to a question about controls
         ! for solver tolerances:

         ! The "residual" is the left over difference between the left and right hand sides
         ! of the equation we are trying to solve.  We do iterations to reduce that, but we
         ! are limited by the non-linearity of the problem and the quality of the estimates
         ! for the derivatives.

         ! The "correction" is the change in the primary variable that is calculated using
         ! good-old Newton's rule in multiple dimensions --- so Jacobian and residuals give
         ! a correction that would make the next residual vanish if the problem were linear
         ! and the Jacobian was exact, neither of which are true.  So the best we can hope
         ! for is that the corrections will get smaller next time.

         ! The "norm" is the average; the "max" is the max.  Sometimes you mainly care about
         ! the norm and will accept a few outliers.  But sometimes you don't want any really
         ! bad outliers, so you want to set a low limit for the max residual or correction
         ! as well as the norm.

         ! You might want to try for several iterations with strict tolerances, and then
         ! relax them if things are still not converged.  For example, you might be willing
         ! to live with the larger tolerances, but you'd like to give it a good try at the
         ! smaller ones before switching.  Also, you might be willing to settle for any-old
         ! residual if the corrections have become small enough.  You can do that too by
         ! relaxing the residual tolerances after a few iterations.

         ! Hope that at least helps with the nomenclature.

         ! I agree with Frank that you should consider the effects of smaller timesteps and
         ! more grid points as your main technique --- tightening up the tolerances for the
         ! solver won't help if you are taking timesteps that are too large or if you have
         ! inadequate grid resolution.
