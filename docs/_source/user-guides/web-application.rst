Web Application: POSYDON Interactive Interface
===============================================

POSYDON provides an interactive web application that enables users to explore and manipulate population synthesis models without directly diving into the code. Whether you're a seasoned astronomer or just curious, the POSYDON web application can be a powerful tool for visualization and analysis.

Overview
--------

The web application offers the following features:

- **Population Synthesis**: Run your own population synthesis model through your broseware without the need to have access to an HPC facility or installing POSYDON on your laptop.
  
- **Model Selection**: Choose from different model assumptions and instantly select the model you want to run.
  
- **Export Options**: Once you have run the desired model, you can easily download the dataset output for further use.

Getting Started
---------------

1. **Accessing the Web Application**

   Visit the official POSYDON web application link: [POSYDON WebApp](https://posydon.odahub.io). TODO: bring it back online and update to v2.0.0
