Database and Query System
=========================

POSYDON offers a robust database and query system, allowing users to access, analyze, and interact with the vast amount of simulation data it produces. This page provides an introduction to the structure of the database and instructions on how to utilize the query system.

Database Overview
-----------------

The POSYDON database has been structured to ensure efficient storage and quick retrieval of data. It comprises:

- **Simulation Data**: Details of individual simulations, including initial conditions, evolution paths, and outcomes.
  
- **Model Assumptions**: Various model assumptions under which the simulations were run.
  
- **Metadata**: Additional information about the simulations, like the date of the run, software version, etc.

Query System
------------

Our query system enables users to:

1. **Search**: Filter and retrieve specific sets of data based on certain criteria.
2. **Analyze**: Compute statistics or perform operations on the retrieved data.
3. **Visualize**: Generate plots and diagrams to better understand the data.
4. **Export**: Extract the queried data for external analysis.

Getting Started with Queries
-----------------------------

1. **Accessing the Query Interface**:
   
   You can access the interface through [this link](link-to-query-interface) or via the POSYDON main software.

2. **Basic Queries**:

   Start by selecting the category of data you're interested in (e.g., 'Simulation Data'). Define the criteria to filter the results.

3. **Advanced Queries**:

   Combine multiple criteria, utilize logical operators (AND, OR), and specify the desired output format.

Tutorials & Examples
--------------------

To help you get started with the query system, we've prepared some tutorials:

2. [Advanced Query Techniques](link-to-advanced-query-tutorial)
3. [Data Analysis using the Query System](link-to-data-analysis-tutorial)

Best Practices
--------------

- Always double-check your query parameters to ensure accuracy.
- For large data retrievals, consider off-peak hours to minimize server load.
- Regularly update yourself with database schema changes from the [version-history.rst](version-history.rst) page.
