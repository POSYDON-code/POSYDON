Using Anaconda (Recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Install Anaconda**

    If you haven't already, download and install Anaconda from `Anaconda's official website <https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution>`_.

2. **Create a New Conda Environment**

    Open your terminal or Anaconda prompt and create a new environment called ``posydon_env`` using Python 3.11 (the ``-y`` automatically answers all confirmations with yes):

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda create --name posydon_env python=3.11 -y

    Activate the new environment:

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda activate posydon_env

3. **Install POSYDON**

    .. warning::
        This documentation describes the POSYDON v2.0.0 code which is not yet available on Anaconda. Please use the development version for now. See :ref:`Using the Development Version <dev-version>` for more details.

    With the environment activated, install the POSYDON code from the POSYDON channel using (by default the installation will take place in the current directory, hence please navigate to your desired location first or use the ``-p`` option to specify a path):

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda install -c posydon posydon

.. _posydon-env:

4. **Download the Dataset**

    .. warning::
        The POSYDON v2.0.0 dataset is not yet available on Zenodo. The above instructions currently point to the POSYDON v1.0.0 dataset release. Please refer to the development version of the dataset available on Northwestern and UNIGE HPC facilities for now. To have access to latest pre-release dataset (230914) you must be a POSYDON core developer, please refer to the #developers Slack channel.

    Refer back to the recommended installation steps, starting from :ref:`point 4 <posydon-env>`, to download the required dataset and set the necessary environment variables.


Using POSYDON on HPC Facilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(TODO: check whether it is still needed)
If you are planning to run POSYDON's population synthesis on a High-Performance Computing (HPC) facility, it's essential to have `mpi4py` installed to enable parallel computations. 

1. **Install mpi4py via Anaconda (Recommended)**:

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda install mpi4py

2. **Alternatively, via pip**:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install ".[hpc]"

    .. warning::
        Users have reported issues when trying to install `mpi4py` via pip. If you encounter any issues, try installing `mpi4py` through Anaconda. If you cannot solve the issue, please refer to the :ref:`Troubleshooting Guide <installation-issues>` or seek support from the community or developers, see the :ref:`contact us <contact_info>` page.

Machine Learning Modules Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For users who wish to utilize POSYDON's latest machine learning features:

        The `open` command works on macOS. If you're using a different OS, you might need to open the `index.html` using your file manager or use a different command.


Installing Jupyter for Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our tutorials are provided as Jupyter notebooks. If you want to run these notebooks interactively, you will need to have either Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook installed.

1. **Using Anaconda (Recommended)**


    If you have already installed Anaconda as suggested earlier in the installation guide, installing Jupyter Lab or Notebook is straightforward:

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab

    Or, for the classic Jupyter Notebook:

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda install -c conda-forge notebook

2. **Alternatively, via pip**


    If you prefer using `pip`, you can also install Jupyter Lab or Notebook using the following commands:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install jupyterlab

    Or, for the classic Jupyter Notebook:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install notebook

3. **After Installation**


    Once installed, you can start Jupyter Lab or Notebook by running:

    .. code-block:: bash

        jupyter lab

    Or:

    .. code-block:: bash

        jupyter notebook

    From the terminal or command prompt. This will open a browser window where you can navigate to the downloaded notebooks and run them interactively.

    .. note::
        Remember to navigate to the directory containing the Jupyter notebooks or you won't see them listed in the Jupyter interface.
