    "The above examples will setup the population run with an array of 10 jobs for each metallicity. As such, each job will run 10 binaries of the 100 binaries per metallicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning the `dump_rate` compared to the number of binaries each job runs can be helpful. However, the larger the `dump_rate` the higher the memory footprint of each job.\n",
    "As a default, 4Gb of RAM is requested per job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the `walltime` and `job_array` can be fine-tuned. A single binary takes about 1-2 seconds to run. Depending on the number of binaries each job does, you might want to raise or lower the walltime for optimal perfomance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with 100.000 binaries split over 100 jobs (per metallicity), means that every job runs 1.000 binaries. `dump_rate=1000` is a good amount of binaries to keep in memory, when you're doing an initial-final run (see here for more details on different run types). This will take around 33 minutes per job. So a walltime of `00:45:00` is reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of setting a `dump_rate`, it's also possible to set a `ram_per_cpu`. The code will try to stay below 90\\% of this limit, but this is not always guaranteed due to additional python overhead."
