Debugging the Evolution of a Single Binary saved in a POSYDON Population model üêû
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This notebook shows you how to run the BinaryPopulation class in debug mode, which allows you to follow the evolution of a single binary through the population synthesis code. This is useful for debugging purposes, or for understanding the evolution of a single binary in detail, e.g. by changing the natal kicks.
