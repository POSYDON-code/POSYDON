Reporting issues
----------------

If you encounter any problems while using POSYDON, we encourage you to report them. By doing so, you can help us improve the software for everyone. This page provides guidelines on how to report issues effectively.

Before Reporting an Issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Check the FAQ**: Before submitting a new issue, please review our [FAQ](link-to-faq-page) to see if your problem has been addressed before.

2. **Update to the Latest Version**: Ensure that you're using the latest version of POSYDON. Some issues may have been resolved in newer releases.

3. **Search Existing Issues**: Look through the `issues on our GitHub repository <https://github.com/POSYDON-code/POSYDON/issues>`_ to check if someone else has already reported the same problem. If you find a match, you can comment on it with any additional information you have.

How to Report an Issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Be Specific**: The title of the issue should be descriptive. Instead of writing "Program crashes," write "Program crashes when processing XYZ data."

2. **Provide Detailed Information**:
    - **Operating System and Version**: E.g., "Windows 10 version 1903" or "Ubuntu 20.04".
    - **POSYDON Version**: Mention the version you are using.
    - **Steps to Reproduce**: List the steps you took that led to the issue.
    - **Expected Behavior vs. Observed Behavior**: Explain what you expected to happen and what actually occurred.
    - **Error Messages**: If there was an error message, please include it (preferably in a text format or as a screenshot).

3. **Include Screenshots or Logs**: If applicable, add screenshots or logs to provide a visual context. This can be especially helpful for UI issues or visual glitches.

4. **Label the Issue**: If you're familiar with GitHub, label your issue (e.g., "bug", "enhancement", "documentation", etc.). If you're unsure, don't worry; our team will label it appropriately after review.

5. **Be Respectful**: Remember that POSYDON is an open-source project. The people helping you are volunteers. Always approach the conversation with respect and patience.

Submitting the Issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you've gathered all the necessary information:

1. Navigate to the `POSYDON GitHub Issues page <https://github.com/POSYDON-code/POSYDON/issues>`_.

3. Fill out the template provided (if any) or use the guidelines above.
4. Click "Submit" to create the issue.

After Reporting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once the issue is reported:

1. **Stay Engaged**: Respond to any questions or feedback from the development team. Your insights can help expedite the resolution.
2. **Updates**: If you find more information or discover a workaround, update the issue with a new comment.
3. **Resolution**: Once the issue is resolved, it'll be closed. You'll be notified via the GitHub notification system.
