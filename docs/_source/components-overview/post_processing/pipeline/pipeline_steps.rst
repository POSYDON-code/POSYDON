Pipeline steps
##############

The pipeline is divided into several steps, which build up on each other. Each
step will take a csv file as input. The name of this file is used to tell the
pipeline, which step should be performed.

The script to run the pipeline takes four arguments:

.. code-block:: bash

    posydon-run-pipeline PATH_TO_GRIDS PATH_TO_CSV_FILE DATA_ID VERBOSE

1. [path] The path to the girds main directory (currently not used)
2. [path] The path to the csv file
3. [int] An index indicating the data entry to read from the csv file
4. [int] Whether one wants verbose output (1) or not (0)

.. note::
    The current directory will be used as working directory, hence navigate to
    your work directory first.

.. _pipeline_step1:

Step1: creating a `PSyGrid` object
----------------------------------

First, we need to create the :samp:`PSyGird` object. To do so, the pipeline
needs to now the directory which contains the MESA runs, the compression, the
grid type, and whether to crop the history for some certain runs. Hence, the
:samp:`step_1.csv` file should have those columns:

.. code-block::

    path_to_grid,compression,grid_type,stop_before_carbon_depletion

And the lines below contain the data for each unique combination of the three
parameters to be processed. Here the :samp:`DATA_ID` simply refers to the line
below the header starting by 0. Thus, the second line in the file has the index
0, the third one has index 1 and so on.

The currently supported compression types are:

.. table:: Compression types

    ========  ===========
    Type      Description
    ========  ===========
    ORIGINAL  It keeps all columns and history entries given by MESA
    LITE      It discards some columns and reduces the history and final profiles to an maximum error of 0.1 and limit profiles to contain in maximum 200 data points
    \*_RLO    The :samp:`_RLO` can be put on any of the previous types to crop the history before the onset of Roche-lobe overflow for grids containing a compact object
    ========  ===========

.. _pipeline_step2:

Step2: combining `PSyGrid` objects
----------------------------------

Usually, the girds are split into batches or reruns are done. In those cases,
there will be several :samp:`PSyGrid` objects created for one gird. This step
will join them into one. The :samp:`step_2.csv` file should have a matrix
structure. The columns contain the girds which should be combined to the one
specified in the header (first) row. The :samp:`DATA_ID` corresponds here to
the column number (starting with 0). Here an example:

.. code-block::

    NEW_H5_FILE1,NEW_H5_FILE2
    OLD_H5_FILE11,OLD_H5_FILE21
    OLD_H5_FILE12,OLD_H5_FILE22
    ,OLD_H5_FILE23

.. warning::
    The data will be put on top of each other. E.g. if there is the same
    initial system in :samp:`OLD_H5_FILE11` and :samp:`OLD_H5_FILE12`, the one
    in :samp:`OLD_H5_FILE11` will be discarded and only the one in
    :samp:`OLD_H5_FILE12` will end up in :samp:`NEW_H5_FILE1`.

.. _pipeline_step3:

Step3: calculating extra values from detailed data
--------------------------------------------------

In this step we calculate extra quantities from the histories and profiles.
Those extra values are key parameters at He depletion, at onset of common
envelope evolution, and at core collapse.

Because some of the values may require a high precision in the data, we
recommend to use the data from the ORIGINAL compression to calculate them. But
the new values can be added to any :samp:`PSyGrid` object. Hence this step
requests three paths to be specified in :samp:`step_3.csv` beside the gird
type:

.. code-block::

    path_to_grid,grid_type,path_to_grid_ORIGINAL,path_to_processed_grid

.. table:: Description of required paths

    ======================  ===========
    Path                    Description
    ======================  ===========
    path_to_grid            path of the gird, which get the values appended to it
    grid_type               type of the grid
    path_to_grid_ORIGINAL   path of the grid, where the values are calculated from
    path_to_processed_grid  path of the new grid (a copy of the one specified as :samp:`path_to_grid` with the appended values)
    ======================  ===========

.. note::
    This step use the path to the original MESA data as the unique identifier
    of each system in the :samp:`PSyGrid` object, thus the location of the MESA
    file cannot be changed between creating two :samp:`PSyGrid` objects of the
    same grid in :ref:`step1 <pipeline_step1>`. Similarly, the overlaying in
    :ref:`step2 <pipeline_step2>` needs to be the same, too. Therefore, we
    recommend to setup and run the pipeline with an
    :ref:`ini file <pipeline_ini>`.

.. _pipeline_step4:

Step4: training of the interpolators
------------------------------------

To get interpolated data from our grids, we train in this step an interpolator
on your :samp:`PSyGrid` object. The file :samp:`step_4.csv` therefore has to
contain three information bits: First, the grid containing the data, second,
the grid type, third, the interpolation method (inlcuding whether the grid
starts at RLO), and finally, the name of the interpolator object.

.. code-block::

    path_to_grid,interpolation_method,path_to_interpolator

.. note::
    The type of interpolator will be recognized from the name of the
    interpolator object. The syntax is :code:`IF_METHOD{_RLO}.pkl`. The
    :samp:`IF` stands for initial-final interpolator, the :samp:`METHOD` refers
    to the interpolator type. The girds starting at Roche-lobe overflow may be
    indicated in the name as well, but is not required.

.. table:: Currently supported interpolator types

    ==============  ===========
    :samp:`METHOD`  Description
    ==============  ===========
    linear          linear interpolation
    1NN             nearest neighbor
    ==============  ===========

.. _pipeline_step9:

Step9: exporting the data set
-----------------------------

After we have a complete data set, we would like to export it to be used for
the population synthesis. We jump here to step 9, because this will always be
the last step even more steps may get introduced in the future. In
:samp:`step_9.csv`, there are again two paths required, a source and an export
path. The step will simply copy the source to the export location. Hence, here
the final :samp:`PSyGrid` objects and all the interpolator files are usually
addressed by this step.

.. code-block::

    path_to_grid,export_path

.. _pipeline_stepR:

StepR: exporting a rerun
------------------------

Usually, a grid will not run well everywhere on the first go. So, there is a
need to export reruns which changes for the next run to fix non converged
models. This step is therefore only needed during the build of a new grid.
Usually, one would run the steps to the point, where the need of a fix arises.
Additionally, before exporting a rerun, the logic how to select a system to be
included in the rerun and what should be changed needs to get implemented
first.

For this step the csv file is called :samp:`rerun.csv` to avoid too much
confusion with other steps. It clearly has to run after a step, but it is no
usual step itself. It requires a path to a :samp:`PSyGrid` object to get the
models from, a path, where the rerun should be stored (it creates in there the
:samp:`grid.csv` and the ini file needed to
:ref:`setup a new run <mesa-grids-api>`), the grid type, the metallicity, the
type of the rerun specifying the logic and changes, and the cluster name.

.. code-block::

    path_to_grid,rerun_path,grid_type,rerun_metallicity,rerun_type,cluster

.. table:: Currently supported rerun types

    =====================  ==============  ===========
    :samp:`rerun_type`     Future version  Description
    =====================  ==============  ===========
    PISN                   default in v3+  it enables the MESA inlist commit, which stops MESA before getting dynamical to save a final profile there
    reverse_MT             default in v3+  it uses a MESA version with a bug fix, that the role of donor and accretor can switch during the simulation
    opacity_max            caution         it uses a fixed maximum opacity of 0.5 (this is only a last option change to get more stability)
    TPAGBwind              default in v3+  it enables the MESA inlist commit, which changes the wind during the TPAGB phase
    thermohaline_mixing    default in v3+  it uses thermohaline mixing in the inlist
    HeMB_MLTp_mesh         workaround      it turns off magnetic braking for He stars; it uses less extreme parameters of the MLT++; it changes some more input values to change the resulation close to the surface
    more_mesh              workaround      it modifies the remeshing and allows for more cells in MESA
    conv_bdy_weight        caution         it disabled the convective_bdy_weight where this caused segmentation faults (this avoids a bug in the old MESA version r11701)
    dedt_energy_eqn        caution         it enables MESA's dedt-form of the energy equation for numerical stability during rapid (superthermal) mass transfer
    dedt_hepulse           caution         it enables MESA's dedt-form of the energy equation for rapid mass transfer. At stripped HeZAMS, several MLT++ changes, v_flag and lnPgas_flag set to .true., and convective_bdy_weight disabled to help with stripped He star superadiabatic envelopes, pulsations, and WD cooling.
