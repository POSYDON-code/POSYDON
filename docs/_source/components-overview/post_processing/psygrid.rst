`PSyGrid` object
################

The :samp:`PSyGrid` object contains the data coming from detailed MESA
simulations.

Import a :samp:`PSyGrid` object by using:

.. code-block:: python

  from posydon.grids.psygrid import PSyGrid


Initializing a `PSyGrid` object
-------------------------------

One can simply get a new :samp:`PSyGrid` object via

.. code-block:: python

    mygrid = PSyGrid()

This calls the initializer, which can take two optional arguments

- :samp:`filepath`: it is the path to the associated h5 file; if the file
  exists the `PSyGrid` object in there will be loaded
- :samp:`verbose`: it is a boolean indicating whether detailed output should be
  given when calling functions of the :samp:`PSyGrid` object


Creating a `PSyGrid` object
---------------------------

The :samp:`create` function of a :samp:`PSyGrid` object will read MESA output
data into the :samp:`PSyGrid` object. Thus it has a required argument and
several optional arguments. The required one is :samp:`MESA_grid_path`, which
is the path to the directory, where the MESA runs are in.

    ==============================  ============  ===========

You can read the MESA data into an existing :samp:`PSyGrid` object, which may
overwrites data:

.. code-block:: python

    mygrid.create(MESA_grid_path=".")

or combine the initialization with the creation:

.. code-block:: python

    mygrid = PSyGrid().create(MESA_grid_path=".")


Loading a `PSyGrid` object
--------------------------

You can load an existing h5 file (e.g. "myPSyGrid.h5") into a :samp:`PSyGrid`
object by

.. code-block:: python

    mygrid.load(filepath="myPSyGrid.h5")

It is more convenient to load the file directly when initializing the
:samp:`PSyGrid` object

.. code-block:: python

    mygrid = PSyGrid(filepath="myPSyGrid.h5")


Contents of a `PSyGrid` object
------------------------------

Print a `PSyGrid` object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To check the content of the :samp:`PSyGrid` object you can simply print it:

.. code-block:: python

    print(mygrid)

This will provide a summary, which tell you

- to which hdf5 file it is connected
- how many runs are in there and have
 
  - a binary history
  - a history of star 1
  - a history of star 2
  - a final profile of star 1
  - a final profile of star 2
   
- the fields in the each of the histories/profiles of the last run
- the fields of the initial and final values
- information on the configuration
- a shorthand list of the MESA directories (the locations of the data the runs
  where extracted from)

To access single runs, it is important to know how many are there to avoid to
call for a non existing one. Hence, you can simply get the number of runs via:

.. code-block:: python

    len(mygrid)

.. note::
    Alternatively you can request the length from the internal number stored in
    :samp:`mygrid.n_runs`.


Accessing data in a `PSyGrid` object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first data you may want to check are the
:ref:`grid properties <tab_grid_properties>`. You can get a list of the
properties available for your :samp:`PSyGrid` object simply with

.. code-block:: python

    mygrid.config.keys()

By providing one of the properties to :samp:`mygrid.config[{PROPERTY}]` you can
access its value.

Next, you can look at the initial and final values of the runs. All the values
are available at :samp:`mygrid.initial_values` and :samp:`mygrid.final_values`,
respectively. To get a tuple of all the available values use

.. code-block:: python

    mygrid.initial_values.dtype.names
    mygrid.final_values.dtype.names

Each value you then get for example via :samp:`mygrid.initial_values[{VALUE}]`.
It will return a numpy array with the this value for all the runs. So you get
the initial mass of star 1 in the third run with

.. code-block:: python

    mygrid.initial_values['star_1_mass'][2]

.. note::
    Remember, that the first run has the index :samp:`0` and the last one
    :samp:`len(mygrid)-1`.

The each initial and final value will have the same number and order of run
entries. This holds for the number of list entries of MESA directories, too.

.. code-block:: python

    mygrid.MESA_dirs

You can get the individual runs via its index. :samp:`mygrid[{IDX}]` is a
:samp:`PSyRunView` object, which contains the data of the run specified with
:samp:`IDX`. The :samp:`PSyRunView` object contains seven components:

.. table:: :samp:`PSyRunView` object components

    ================  ===========
    Component         Description
    ================  ===========
    'initial_values'  all initial values of the run
    'final_values'    all final values of the run including termination flags
    'binary_history'  the binary history
    'history1'        the history of star 1
    'history2'        the history of star 2
    'final_profile1'  the final profile of star 1
    'final_profile2'  the final profile of star 2
    ================  ===========

Again you can check for the contents of the components with
:samp:`dtype.names`, e.g.

.. code-block:: python

    myrun = mygrid[0]
    myrun['binary_history'].dtype.names

Now you know a second way to get the initial mass of star 1 in the third run
with a one-liner

.. code-block :: python

    mygrid[2]['initial_values']['star_1_mass']

You would may think of a third way being

.. code-block :: python

    mygrid[2]['binary_history']['star_1_mass'][0]

But this will not give the initial value, while it is close to it. The reason
for this not being the same is in MESA having a slightly different value in the
first line of the history files compared to the given initial value. The final
values and the derived initial values instead are the same as the last or first
values in the corresponding history.

.. note::
    For efficiency reasons not all the :samp:`PSyGrid` object is loaded into
    RAM. Instead parts are reads from the associated hdf5 file if needed. This
    has the consequence, that it is discouraged to refer to the same values
    more than once in a code. If you need the same value more often, you should
    store it in a local variable.


Plot a `PSyGrid` object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beside getting the values itself there are plotting functionalities available
to display the content of a :samp:`PSyGrid` object. There are three main plotting
functionalities:

- :samp:`plot`: This creates a one dimensional plot from the :samp:`PSyGrid`.
  An example can be found in the :ref:`tutorials <plot_1d>`. The code details
  are available in the
  :py:func:`PSyGrid.plot <posydon.grids.psygrid.PSyGrid.plot>` code and the
  :py:class:`visualisation libary <posydon.visualization.plot1D>`.
- :samp:`plot2D`: This creates a two dimensional representation from the
  :samp:`PSyGrid`. Again, an example can be found in the
  :ref:`tutorials <plot_2d>`. The code details are available in the
  :py:func:`PSyGrid.plot <posydon.grids.psygrid.PSyGrid.plot2D>` code and the
  :py:class:`visualisation libary <posydon.visualization.plot2D>`.
- :samp:`HR`: This is similar to :samp:`plot` but specialized on producing
  Hertzsprung–Russell diagrams.


Work on/with a `PSyGrid` object
-------------------------------

Loop on a `PSyGrid` object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similarly to accessing a single value in the :samp:`PSyGrid` object we can loop
over a :samp:`PSyGrid` object, which will loop over the individual runs in the
:samp:`PSyGrid` object. Hence the following two codes will produce the same
output. The first one loops through the numpy array if the initial companion
mass

.. code-block:: python

    for mass in mygrid.initial_values['star_2_mass']:
        print(mass)

while the second one loops through the runs and prints the initial companion
mass

.. code-block:: python

    for run in mygrid:
        print(run['initial_values']['star_2_mass'])



Expand a `PSyGrid` object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because of the complexity of the :samp:`PSyGrid` object we encourage the user
to only use our dedicated functions to add content to the object. There is a
function to add an extra column to the :samp:`final_values`. Here is an example
how to add a new column which contains the final orbital period in units of
years instead of days:

.. code-block:: python

    new_column_data = mygrid.final_values['period_days']/365.25
    mygrid.add_column('period_years', new_column_data, where='final_values', overwrite=False)

The four arguments are a string with the name of the new field, the data to be
stored in there, to which component of the :samp:`PSyGrid` object it should get
added, and whether a field with the same name should be overwritten, if it
already exists.

.. warning::
    The new data has to have as many entries as the :samp:`PSyGrid` object has
    runs.

.. note::
    Currently, the parameter :samp:`where` only supports the value
    'final_values'.


Join two or more `PSyGrid` objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are different reasons, why you create several :samp:`PSyGrid` objects
which you would like to combine to a single one later, e.g. adding reruns.
There is a functionality to do this for you. To avoid too many conflicts of
possible modifications of already loaded :samp:`PSyGrid` objects, this function
is not part of the :samp:`PSyGrid`-object class. Instead it take a list of
paths to the hdf5 files containing :samp:`PSyGrid` objects to be combined to a
new one. Those are the two required arguments of the :samp:`join_grids`
function. Additionally, you can specify the arguments :samp:`compression`,
:samp:`description`, and :samp:`verbose`. The :samp:`join_grids` function will
check, whether the grids are compatible and join them if possible.

.. note::
    If there are common systems in two or more grids, this routine will only
    put the last run with same initial conditions in the newly combined
    :samp:`PSyGrid` object.

We recommend to use the :ref:`post-processing pipeline <pipeline>` to create
and join grids.

..
    Extract the initial and final values as a pandas data frame
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    TODO: get_pandas_initial_final()


Get reruns from a `PSyGrid` object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usually, not all runs of a grid will be successfully run in MESA. Hence, one
may wants to rerun some of them with changed parameters. There is a function,
to export runs from a :samp:`PSyGrid` object. There are two general ways to
specify, which systems should be exported to rerun:

1. Write your own logic and create a numpy array with the indexes of the systems, you would like to run again.
2. Specify, which termination flag(s) the systems should have to be rerun.

..
    .. table:: Arguments of the :samp:`rerun` function

    =================  =======  ===========
    Argument           Default  Description
    =================  =======  ===========
    path_to_file       './'     where to create the file(s) for the rerun
    runs_to_rerun      None     a numpy array containing the indexes of the runs in the :samp:`PSyGrid` object (if given, leave :samp:`termination_flags=None`)
    termination_flags  None     a single termination flag code or a list of them (if given, leave :samp:`runs_to_rerun=None`)
    new_mesa_flag      None     dictionary with the names and the values of MESA parameters to be changed for the inlists of the new runs
    =================  =======  ===========

.. table:: Arguments of the :samp:`rerun` function

    =================  =======  ===========
    Argument           Default  Description
    =================  =======  ===========
    path_to_file       './'     where to create the file(s) for the rerun
    runs_to_rerun      None     a list containing the indexes of the runs in the :samp:`PSyGrid` object
    termination_flags  None     a single termination flag code or a list of them
    new_mesa_flag      None     dictionary with the names and the values of MESA parameters to be changed for the inlists of the new runs
    flags_to_check     None     a termination flag key or a list of them (if None check only 'termination_flag_1')
    =================  =======  ===========

.. note::
    If both :samp:`runs_to_rerun` and :samp:`termination_flags` is given, all
    systems matching at least one of the two will be selected for rerun.

The :ref:`post-processing pipeline <pipeline_stepR>` already provides some pre
defined rerun options.


Close associated hdf5 file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, you can close the hdf5 file, which is recommended to ensure that all
your changes on the :samp:`PSyGrid` object is safely written into the file.

.. code-block:: python

    mygrid.close()

This is done as well, in the case you call the destructor of the
:samp:`PSyGrid` object.

.. code-block:: python

    del mygrid


The code summary of the :samp:`PSyGrid` object can be found at the
:py:class:`~posydon.grids.psygrid` reference page.
