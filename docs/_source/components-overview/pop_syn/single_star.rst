The SingleStar object
=====================

The Single Star object contains the current and past states of the star.
Only parameters in the ``STARPROPERTIES`` list are stored in the history.
The current parameter value of the star object is accessed as, e.g. ``star.mass`` while its past history with ``star.mass_history``.

To use SingleStar object import it using:

.. code-block:: python

  from posydon.binary_evol.singlestar import SingleStar

State options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Star states are defined by their burning and surface properties.
These states are combined to describe the stellar state.
We also have additional extra states for objects that are not stars.

.. list-table:: Surface state
  :header-rows: 1
  :widths: 10 30

  * - State
    - Description
  * - ``H-rich``
    - The star has a hydrogen-rich surface.
  * - ``stripped_He``
    - The star has a stripped helium surface.
  * - ``accreted_He``
    - The star has accreted a helium rich layer on its surface.
  
.. list-table:: Burning state
  :header-rows: 1
  :widths: 10 30

  * - State
    - Description
  * - ``non_burning``
    - The star is not burning.
  * - ``Core_H_burning``
    - The star is burning hydrogen in its core.
  * - ``Shell_H_burning``
    - The star is burning hydrogen in a shell.
  * - ``Core_He_burning``
    - The star is burning helium in its core.
  * - ``Central_He_depleted``
    - The star has a helium depleted core.
  * - ``Shell_He_burning``

  * - ``Core_C_burning``
    - The star is burning carbon in its core.
  * - ``Central_C_depletion``
    - The star has a carbon depleted core.

.. list-table:: Additional States
  :header-rows: 1
  :widths: 10 30

  * - State
    - Description
  * - ``WD``
    - The star is a White Dwarf.
  * - ``NS``
    - The star is a Neutron Star.
  * - ``BH``
    - The star is a Black Hole.
  * - ``massless_remnant``
    - The star exploded or merged. Only its companion is left as a single star.

Basic example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest method is to provide `kwargs` of the initial stellar parameters.

.. code-block:: python

  kwargs = {'state' : 'MS',
            'mass' : 10.0,
            'metallicity' : 0.014}
  SingleStar(**kwargs)

Now, the SingleStar object is ready to be used.
