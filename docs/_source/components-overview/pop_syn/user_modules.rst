User Modules
------------

To allow users to add code easily within the POSYDON namespace without modifying the code core we added a directory called :samp:`user_modules`. There users can put their own code and simply import it as any other function within the posydon namespace.

Additionally, we have an example file there which demonstrates how to modify the :ref:`flow chart <flow-chart>`.
