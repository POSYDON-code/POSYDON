User Modules
------------

To allow users to add code easily within the POSYDON namespace without modifying the code core we added a directory called :samp:`user_modules`. There users can put any own code and simply import it as any other function within the posydon name space.

Additionally, we have there an example file of a case which modifies the :ref:`flow chart <flow_chart>`.
