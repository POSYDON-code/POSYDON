.. _binary-star:


The BinaryStar object
======================

The ``BinaryStar`` object is composed of two ``SingleStar`` objects (see :ref:`single-star`) and contains the current and past states of the binary.
Only parameters in the ``BINARYPROPERTIES`` list are stored in the history. 
The current parameter value of the star object is accessed with, e.g. ``binary.orbital_period`` and the past history via ``binary.orbital_period_history``.
The two stars are accessed with, e.g. (for star 1), ``binary.star_1.mass`` and the past history via ``binary.star_1.mass_history``.

To use BinaryStar object import it using:

.. code-block:: python

  from posydon.binary_evol.singlestar import SingleStar
  from posydon.binary_evol.binarystar import BinaryStar

Additional scalar properties can be added during the evolution.

Since they do not change over time, they are not stored in the history.
These can be requested and will be stored in the output oneline (See the :ref:`Synthetic Population<synthetic-population>` and :ref:`Population Parameter Guide<pop-params-guide>` for more information).

Basic example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest method is to provide the two star objects and `kwargs` of the initial binary parameters.

.. code-block:: python

  kwargs1 = {'state' : 'MS',
             'mass' : 20.0,
             'metallicity' : 0.014}

  star_1 = SingleStar(**kwargs1)

  kwargs2 = {'state' : 'MS',
             'mass' : 10.0,
             'metallicity' : 0.014}

  star_2 = SingleStar(**kwargs2)

  kwargs3 = {'state' : 'detached',
             'event' : None,
             'time' : 0.,
             'orbital_period' : 3.,
             'eccentricity' : 0.}


  binary = BinaryStar(star_1, star_2, **kwargs3)
