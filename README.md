# POSYDON

POSYDON is a next-generation single and binary-star population synthesis code incorporating full stellar structure and evolution modeling with the use of the MESA code (https://docs.mesastar.org).

POSYDON is being developed by a collaborative team of astrophysicists and computer scientists led by Principal Investigators Tassos Fragos (Université de Genève) and Vicky Kalogera (Northwestern University). The code is modular in many aspects and the user can specify initial population properties and adopt choices that determine how stellar evolution proceeds. Populations are simulated with the use of detailed evolutionary tracks for single, non-interacting, and interacting binaries organized in grids. Machine-learning methods are incorporated and applied on the grids for classification and various interpolation calculations, and the development of irregular grids guided by active learning, for computational efficiency.
