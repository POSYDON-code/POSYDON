This page lists published works that utilized the POSYDON code. Each entry provides a brief description summarizing the main findings of each study. Researchers using POSYDON have made significant contributions to our understanding of binary stars and their evolutionary paths.

- `The formation of merging black holes with masses beyond 30 MâŠ™ at solar metallicity <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023NatAs.tmp..142B/abstract>`_, **Bavera et al. (2023)**, The study unveils the impact of stellar winds and binary interactions on the maximum mass of black holes formed in isolated binaries at solar metallicity. Leveraging detailed stellar structure and binary evolution calculations in population-synthesis models, a distinct perspective emerges for the formation of black-hole binaries, contrasting prior rapid population synthesis models. 

(TODO Continue with other referenced works using POSYDON, following the same structure...)
